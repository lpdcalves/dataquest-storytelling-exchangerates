# Storytelling Data Visualization on Exchange Rates

This repo contains [lpdcalves](https://github.com/lpdcalves) and [rodolfostark](https://github.com/rodolfostark)'s implementation of Dataquest's Guided Project: [Storytelling Data Visualization on Exchange Rates](https://app.dataquest.io/c/96/m/529/guided-project%3A-storytelling-data-visualization-on-exchange-rates).

The idea behind this Guided Project is to use the most commom datascience techniques (data exploration, data cleaning, etc) on a dataset containing the exchange rates of the Euro to more than 40 different coins around the world, and then use concepts of Storytelling with Data to create nice-looking graphs that tell a story.

On top of that, we used common clean code, documentation and code-safety techniques to ensure the code was as close to a production ready code as possible.

Below we have some graphs generated troughout the code:

#### Euro to Dollar Exchange Rate

### Dependencies

This repo depends uppon the following python libs:
 
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

We also use `pylint` to check if the code is up to [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) standards.
